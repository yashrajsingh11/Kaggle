# Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster Without ML Libraries

### Libraries used - 

1. Pandas (For Data Handling and Pre-processing)
2. Numpy (For Data Handling and Pre-processing)
3. Matplotlib (For Data Analysis)
4. Seaborn (For Data Analysis)
5. Scikit Learn (For Model Training) 

### My Approach - 

The approach was similar to the one which I used in predicting the output without using any ML Libraries. The only difference was in model training.

### Model -

For this I used [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) from Scikit-Learn.

3. Predictions -

The highest accuracy score I reached using this model was 0.775.
